For a while, many believed it to be the height of Praxis rule.  So many commoners had become well known throughout the surrounding areas for their heroic, although some nefarious, acts.  But sometimes one can not see what is right in front of them.  The administrators of Praxis grew lazy and corrupt.  The streets were no long safe and the economy began to suffer.  Businesses moved away, adventurers began to set up home in other areas, and communications with Praxis soon became silent.

Over the years, the same heroes that once help Praxis become the hub of activity began to disappear.  Some would go on more time consuming quests.  Others would retreat to far off lands to discover new realms while some perished attempting to save Praxis from the harm that often laid siege to it in the form of nomadic races or demons sent from the gods.

A Dark Age fell on Praxis and it's surrounding areas.  Well known areas became simply backdrops in epic tales.  Once well maintained roads were retaken by nature.  Whole neighborhoods and nearby towns became the foundation for wilderness overgrowth and home to wild animals.  Advancements in teaching suffered to the point where knowledge and literature on magic and religion were lost.  The realm once known so well simply ceased to exist.

Those who chose to try regain control of their lives moved to the far north where land was vast and fertile.  Some chose to sail to newly discovered realms that offered more protection from the evils that Praxis could no longer stop. And for some, they simply lived in the darkness only to either become victims or become part of that darkness.

Inspiration is a powerful thing, though.  As these new realms grew in both population and resources, many of the stories of the Old Realm and of Praxis began to spark some intrigue and interest in returning to the Old Realm.  It started when a small group of fearless adventurers decided to return to the home of their ancestors and retake it from the darkness.  With word returning that they had successfully retaken Praxis, some courageous citizens saw an opportunity to rebuild Praxis and to return it to it's former glory.  Praxis was to rise again.
