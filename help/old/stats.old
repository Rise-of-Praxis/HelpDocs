Stats define the personal traits of a characters physical makeup.  Stats are usually the only thing that separates characters of the same race. 

Rise of Praxis has the following stats:
%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Physical Stats%^RESET%^
%^CYAN%^Strength%^RESET%^: Defines how physically strong a character is.
%^CYAN%^Durability%^RESET%^: Defines how well a character can handle damage and heal.
%^CYAN%^Agility%^RESET%^:  Defines how well a character moves around.  A very agile character has a better chance at dodging.
%^CYAN%^Speed%^RESET%^:  Defines how quickly a character moves.  A fast character is not always agile.
%^CYAN%^Coordination%^RESET%^:  Defines how well a character can handle objects.

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Mental Stats%^RESET%^
%^CYAN%^Intelligence%^RESET%^:  Defines the books smarts of a character.  The smarter you are, the more you can study and remember.
%^CYAN%^Wisdom%^RESET%^:  Defines the spiritual enlightenment of a character.
%^CYAN%^Psi%^RESET%^:  Defines the psychological fortitude of a character.  Characters with low Psi often succumb to mental games or attacks.  Characters with high Psi can often use that to their advantage in magic to mental attack an enemy.

%^BOLD%^%^GREEN%^Other Stats%^RESET%^
%^CYAN%^Charisma%^RESET%^:  Charisma is how well a character socially interacts and communicates with others.
%^CYAN%^Luck%^RESET%^:  Luck is often used as a modifier to increase or decrease success.

The natural range of values for a stat breaks down into 5 categories:
%^BOLD%^1 - 10%^RESET%^:  A character with a stat in this range is deemed to be debilitated/severely retarded in that stat.  Penalties are often applied when a stat is in this range.
%^BOLD%^11 - 30%^RESET%^:  The character is below average.  While the character is often not penalized for being below average, some penalties might be levied against the player.
%^BOLD%^31 - 70%^RESET%^: The character is average for their race.  There are no bonuses or penalties applied to anything.
%^BOLD%^71 - 90%^RESET%^: The character is above average.  Just like below average characters, characters with above average stats may get a small bonus in certain aspects of the game.
%^BOLD%^91 - 100%^RESET%^: A character with a stat in the top 10% is considered to be gifted for their race.

Values may go above or below the natural range, but only with the aid of magic or other type of intervention.  Stats do not change as you increase in level, but will change with age.

It should be noted that a stat level for one race does not necessarily match that of another race.  For example, the average human with average strength might be weaker than a half-giant with below average strength.
