Rangers are only concerned with one thing: survival. As such, they use the survival skill to fish and trap game.
With the onset of the improve system and the ridiculousness of wasting points on swimming the people moved away from the 
seas and became rangers thus rendering the need for fishers obsolete fear of being unable to swim in the seas 
killed the fishers
