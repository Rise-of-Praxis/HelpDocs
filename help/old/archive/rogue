%^BOLD%^Rogues:%^RESET%^

Rogues are an extremely varied bunch of scum who spend their days
practicing the less accepted crafts of society.  Though skills such as
lock picking are often desired in adventuring parties, skills such as
stealing make people avoid them.

Rogues are designed for people who like to role-play and adventure in
groups.  The role-player will find the unique character of being a
thief challenging, and people who enjoy group adventuring will find
their skills in high demand.

Their default skills are:

Primary skills:       knife attack, parrying, stealing, stealth
Secondary skills:     bargaining, hunting, multi-weapon
Other skills:         dodging

Use the command: "%^BOLD%^improve -list%^RESET%^" for specific descriptions of each skill.
