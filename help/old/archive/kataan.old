%^BOLD%^Kataans:%^RESET%^

Kataans are the complete opposite of clerics. Where clerics vow to do no violence, kataans revel in it. A kataan is willing and eager to do battle, but he is not the physical sort of warrior. If it were not for the dark god, Lintokh, a kataan might be seen as a mere battle mage. But all kataans worship Lintokh and are willing to pay him in blood for the spells and abilities he grants.

Kataans are generally not tolerant of outsiders. When training, they either fight alone or group with others of their class. A kataan would rather kill someone than befriend them. A kataan is also not above pretending to be a friend only to kill that friend later. It all depends on Lintokh's will or the kataan's hunger for power.

Because of this, you can often find a kataan engaged in Player vs Player (PvP) combat. If you're lucky, you find one, but most often you won't find a kataan because he is very skilled in hiding himself. And, chances are, you will end up being sacrificed by the very kataan you were looking for.

Their default skills are:

Primary skills:     evocation, faith, polearm attack, stealth
Secondary skills:   blunt attack, parrying, stealing
Other skills:       conjuring

Stats needed for the Kataan Class
	Major: Willpower, Coordination, Wisdom, Luck
	Minor: Intelligence, Agility, Strength, Charisma

Use the command: "%^BOLD%^improve -list%^RESET%^" for specific descriptions of each skill.
Typing %^YELLOW%^help <stat>%^RESET%^ also works.
