%^BOLD%^Kataans:%^RESET%^

Kataans are by default a demonic class that uses their faith to do dark blood 
magics in their worship of Lintokh.  

Kataans are designed for people who like to role-play and adventure in
groups.  The role-player will find the unique character of being a
Kataan very challenging, and people who enjoy group adventuring will find
their skills in high demand.

Their default skills are:

Primary skills:     evocation, faith, polearm attack, stealth
Secondary skills:   blunt attack, parrying, stealing
Other skills:       conjuring

Use the command: "%^BOLD%^improve -list%^RESET%^" for specific descriptions of each skill.
